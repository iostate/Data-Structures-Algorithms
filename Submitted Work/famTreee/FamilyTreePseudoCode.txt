PseudoCode for FamilyTree: (Uses a data structure that allows for left, middle, and right node since some people decided to have 3 children. They obviously didnâ€™t think far enough into the future, and now I have to improvise)

1) Add grandma as root. If array is empty, set left and right nodes to null

2) Add Ney as leaf Node, set parent node to root

3) Add Mother as leaf node, set parent node to root

4) Add Lina as leaf node, set parent to root

5) Add Chico as leaf node, set parent to root

6) Set Jose as leaf node, set parent to root


Children.. (Uses find() method to locate parent)

7) Find mother, set left node as Me

8) Find mother, set Lan as Right node

9) Find Lina, set Paco as left Node

10) Find Lina, set Arlen as Middle Node

11) Find Lina, set Diego as Right Node

12) Find Jose, set Renan as left node.

13) Find Jose, set Yuridhia as middle Node.
